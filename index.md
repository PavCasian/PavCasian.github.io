Improved the previous Sparta project by following a strict object-oriented approach. Replaced the methods for a more efficient processing (x6 faster) and increased reliability of the data through introducing additional validation (e.g. merging on two fields when a unique identifier is lacking). <a>https://github.com/PavCasian/Data8Project/tree/development</a>
